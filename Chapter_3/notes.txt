----- CODE -----
print() - works with both Python 2.7 and 3 (instead of print statement)

argparse - used to parse command line arguments (in this case the only argument we need is "--image", the path to the image)

cv2.imread(*path to file*) - returns a NumPy array representing the image

cv2.imshow(*window name*, *image*) - displays image on screen

cv2.waitKey(*keys*) - pauses execution of script until key is pressed, parameter of 0 indicates that any keypress will unpause

cv2.imwrite(*path to file*, *image*) - saving image in any format, handled by OpenCV

----- Notes -----
channels - output is 3 because RGB components

image NumPy shape is (600 pixels, 900 pixels, 3) - it is common to define matrics as rows * columns
