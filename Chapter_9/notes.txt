Thresholding:

	cv2.threshold(img, threshold_value, max_value, method) - image must be passed in as grayscale, any value greater than threshold_value will be set to max_value, methods: cv2.THRESH_BINARY, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, returns a tuple (threshold_value, thresholded_img)

	thresholding is the binariation of an image where pixels are either 0 or 255

	threshold value must be specified so that all pixel intensities less than this are set to 0 and greater than this are set to 255
