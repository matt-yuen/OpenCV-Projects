----- Notes -----
pixels
	grayscale - 0 to 255 (black to white)
	colour - represented in RGB, usually use 8-bit unsigned integer to represent each colour intensity

images are represented as grids of pixels - top left corner is (0, 0)

image[*x*, *y*] - returns array of RGB components of that pixel ([b, g, r]), OpenCV stores RBG in reverse order (BGR)

image[*start_row*:*end_row*, *start_col*:*end_col*] - array slicing
